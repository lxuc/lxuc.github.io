title: Shared memory bank conflicts
category: GPU

To achieve high memory bandwidth for concurrent accesses, shared memory is divided into equally sized memory modules (banks) that can be accessed simultaneously. Therefore, any memory load or store of n addresses that spans b distinct memory banks can be serviced simultaneously, yielding an effective bandwidth that is b times as high as the bandwidth of a single bank.

However, if multiple threadsâ€™ requested addresses map to the same memory bank, the accesses are serialized. The hardware splits a conflicting memory request into as many separate conflict-free requests as necessary, decreasing the effective bandwidth by a factor equal to the number of colliding memory requests. An exception is the case where all threads in a warp address the same shared memory address, resulting in a broadcast. Devices of compute capability 2.0 and higher have the additional ability to multicast shared memory accesses, meaning that multiple accesses to the same location by any number of threads within a warp are served simultaneously.

To minimize bank conflicts, it is important to understand how memory addresses map to memory banks. Shared memory banks are organized such that successive 32-bit words are assigned to successive banks and the bandwidth is 32 bits per bank per clock cycle. For devices of compute capability 1.x, the warp size is 32 threads and the number of banks is 16. A shared memory request for a warp is split into one request for the first half of the warp and one request for the second half of the warp. Note that no bank conflict occurs if only one memory location per bank is accessed by a half warp of threads.

For devices of compute capability 2.0, the warp size is 32 threads and the number of banks is also 32. A shared memory request for a warp is not split as with devices of compute capability 1.x, meaning that bank conflicts can occur between threads in the first half of a warp and threads in the second half of the same warp.

Devices of compute capability 3.x have configurable bank size, which can be set using cudaDeviceSetSharedMemConfig() to either four bytes (cudaSharedMemBankSizeFourByte, the default) or eight bytes (cudaSharedMemBankSizeEightByte). Setting the bank size to eight bytes can help avoid shared memory bank conflicts when accessing double precision data.
